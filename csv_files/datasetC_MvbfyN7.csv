"“Do you remember how I made my political party and do you remember the days of my struggle?” Imran Khan posed this question to me at the start of a recent meeting that took place days after his victory in the general elections 2018. It was not a formal interview. It was just a coffee meeting in his Banigala office where a big change was visible a few days before his oath as the prime minister. I was asked to deposit my mobile phone at the entrance of his office. It never happened in the last so many years since he shifted from the posh E-7 area to the hill top of Banigala in Islamabad. I suddenly realised, oh! I am going to meet the new prime minister of Pakistan. Before meeting Imran Khan, I saw former chief minister of KP Pervaiz Khattak, his old comrades Dr Arif Alvi and Muneeza Hasan sitting in a nicely decorated waiting room next to the office of Imran Khan. It will become the camp office of the new prime minister on weekends because Imran Khan will not spend his weekends in the official residence of the prime minister. Imran Khan met me with a tension-free smiling face. During our conversation, he was mentioning the big challenges waiting for him with a smile on his face. This time he was not talking against Nawaz Sharif or Asif Zardari. He was talking about the energy crisis, water shortage and debt problem. When I said problems are big and opposition in parliament is also very big, he said: “Many people used to say Imran Khan cannot become prime minister, now the same people saying Imran Khan cannot resolve our problems but wait and see I will defeat these problems.” Imran Khan was very much aware that he may face some difficulties in the election ofspeaker and deputy of the National Assembly. The election of prime minister will be open but the election of speaker and deputy speaker will be held through secret ballot. He was confident that he will easily win the speaker's election. “I am not worried from this opposition, they are not natural allies,” he added. He surprised me by saying that he is ready to meet Baloch leader Akhtar Mengal and he will support his six demands. The first demand of Balochistan National Party (BNP) head is about missing persons. He is demanding to produce all the missing persons in a court of law. He has only three seats in the National Assembly but Imran Khan was not supporting his six demands just for three votes. He said: “I supported six points of Akhtar Mengal in 2012 and I will try to address his six demands in 2018 as prime minister because I see nothing wrong in his demands."" Akhtar Mengal is one of those who are openly talking about pre-poll and after poll rigging in the 2018 election. He is an old critic of the powerful military establishment. Imran Khan can become the prime minister without his three votes but his engagement with the BNP is a message for all those who think that he is a puppet of powerful forces who never wanted to see people like Akhtar Mengal in parliament. Imran Khan is committed to resolving the issue of missing persons with the help of army and all the concerned State institutions. It was Imran Khan who first broke the disappearance story of Dr. Aafia Siddiqui from Karachi in my TV show Capital Talk on Geo News in 2003. Then Interior Minister Faisal Saleh Hayat was present in the show. Dr Aafia is now spending her life in a US prison and Imran Khan cannot afford to remain silent about her. The issue of missing persons was directly linked with the war against terrorism. A big number of people were picked up by security agencies for their alleged links with militants and Imran Khan was one of those who were loudly saying “it is not our war, it is America’s war, we should not fight with our own people, and we should produce all disappeared persons in the courts of law”. Many critics declared him Taliban Khan. In one of my shows in 2005, the Information Minister of Pervez Musharraf regime, Sheikh Rashid Ahmad, declared him “du takey ka kaptan” (two penny captain) in his face but today the same Sheikh is an ally of Imran Khan along with many others who used to make fun of the cricketer who was trying to become the Prime Minister of Pakistan in the presence of many feudal lords and industrialists. Nobody can deny the fact that Imran Khan struggled hard and never opted for short cuts. He was offered a ministry by late General Ziaul Haq in 1988 after the dismissal of Muhammad Khan Junejo’s government. Imran regretted. He was again offered a ministry in the caretaker government of Moeen Qureshi in 1993 but he refused. He established his political party in 1996 and I was one of those who never endorsed his idea of joining politics at that time. I was more concerned about his cancer hospital which was inaugurated in 1994 and needed much attention from Imran. Nawaz Sharif offered him an alliance in 1997 election with 20 National Assembly seats but he refused. He contested his first election in 1997 and badly lost everywhere. Just few days before the 2002 election, General Pervez Musharraf forced him to make alliance with PML-Q but Imran refused. Then DG ISI Gen. Ehsan failed to convince Imran to join a government led by the PML-Q and in the end the PTI got only one seat in the 2002 election. In the next seven years, Imran Khan was one of those who resisted the policies of General Musharraf inside and outside parliament with full force and courage. Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif were in exile and Imran Khan was the one who appeared in my shows again and again to criticise Musharraf. Geo TV faced problems many times due to the “bad mouthing"" of Imran Khan against Musharraf in 'Capital Talk'. Musharraf used the MQM many times to teach us a lesson by shutting down Geo on cable in Karachi. Many times Imran Khan was humiliated by MQM ministers in talk shows but he never gave up. He made an alliance with Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif after the 2007 emergency imposed by Musharraf. Imran Khan played a major role in the lawyer’s movement and opposed restrictions imposed on the media. He participated in my road shows many times when I was banned by Musharraf on TV. He was arrested and thrown in jail but he never made a deal with Musharraf. He refused to contest election under Musharraf regime after the assassination of Benazir Bhutto in 2007. On the other side the PPP made a deal with Musharraf. The PML-N decided to contest election under Musharraf regime while Imran Khan was shouting on roads to boycott the election under a military dictator. I remember that I met him one cold January night in his party office and asked him not to boycott elections because the PML-N will finally decide to contest elections. Imran Khan never believed me. He mentioned the commitment given to him by Nawaz Sharif publicaly. He told me: “I don’t trust Zardari, he can betray me but Nawaz Sharif gave his word not only to me he also gave word to JI chief Qazi Hussain Ahmad and PkMAP chief Mahmood Khan Achakzai; he will not betray us”. Unfortunately I was proved right. First the PPP and then the PML-N decided to contest election under Musharraf. Imran Khan felt betrayed by the PPP and PML-N. The PPP made a coalition government with the PML-N and both parties became a target of Imran Khan. That was the time when PPP voters in Punjab and KP started moving towards the PTI. Those were the days when drone attacks by America in Pakistani tribal areas were on the rise. Imran Khan was the only national leader who organised a long march against drone attacks. His ex-wife Jemima helped him by making a documentary on drone attacks and she also appeared in my TV show to criticise the drone attacks. Imran Khan attacked the ruling elite from Sindh to Punjab and also taking a tough position against American policies in the region. His anti-Americanism made him a hero of angry youth and that youth became his biggest strength. He emerged as a third political force in 2013 election. He wiped out the PPP from Punjab and the ANP from KP. He became a proponent of change in Pakistan but slowly and gradually his party became a den of many famous turncoats. Imran Khan tried to defend them by declaring them as “electables” but the people of Pakistan rejected most of “electables” in 2018 elections. The PTI led by Imran Khan became the largest party in the National Assembly but all other big parties are making noise of rigging. Once again the PPP and the PML-N have made an alliance but top PPP leaders Asif Zardari and Bilawal have many reservations. They know that their reconciliation policy with the PML-N in the past only benefited Imran Khan and if they will shake hand with the PML-N again, they may lose more support this time in Sindh. The PPP is reluctant to openly support the PML-N in the Punjab Assembly. The PPP and PML-N leaderships failed to cultivate the support of parties like the MQM and BNP who were the first in the night of 25th July to make noise against rigging. Imran Khan successfully managed to get the support of former Musharraf allies like the MQM and the PML-Q and an anti-establishment Baloch party BNP. It will be very difficult to maintain the support of all these smaller parties without fulfilling their demands and this is one of the big challenges Imran may face in coming days. Before touching the big foreign policy challenges, he needs to establish his credibility by inducting credible people in the government. Despite many apprehensions by his well wishers, he will try his best to avoid confrontation with the state institutions. We may not see weekly National Security Committee (NSC) meetings in the beginning. Imran Khan will move forward taking all stakeholders on board but we may not see him taking dictation from anyone. Imran asked me about his speech after the election. I said your humbleness was a positive gesture. We also discussed why Indian star Aamir Khan is not coming to his oath taking. I guessed that Aamir is not busy, may be he is under pressure. Imran never made any comments and just smiled. We discussed Indian PM Modi’s telephone call to him. He told me Modi never mentioned Kashmir but ""I am committed to Kashmir cause"". Imran Kahn must set examples to establish that he believes in the rule of law and law is equal for everyone. NAB summoned him in the helicopter case on August 7. They will ask him about the alleged misuse of KP government’s helicopter. He may not go to NAB in person on August 7 but the Imran Khan I know must appear in front of NAB team after taking oath as prime minister. By appearing before NAB, a sitting prime minister can give a message to the whole world that it’s the beginning of a New Pakistan (Naya Pakistan). He should also respect criticism and critics. I criticised him many times in the past but he never complained. Imran Khan must introduce a tolerant policy for the media and win support for his government through good governance, and not through unseen pressures. Imran Khan must realise that he has become a majority leader not due to his manifesto, but because of the blunders and mistakes of his political opponents. Now his opponents are waiting for his mistakes. He cannot afford any mistakes because once this opposition will get united and start marching towards Islamabad Imran Khan will not be able to defend his government without public support. He needs more public support with pro-public policies.","Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) legislatures in the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa assembly are not keen on resigning from the provincial assembly, party insiders told The Express Tribune on Monday. PTI provincial assembly members were in a defiant mood, insiders said while requesting anonymity. They added that “the chief minister and the speaker K-P assembly expressed their serious concerns on the decision during a meeting held in the federal capital.” “Yes, the two, CM K-P and speaker K-P assembly resisted the idea of tendering  resignations from the provincial assembly, instead they were of the view that they will form another government by taking 14 disgruntled members of PTI onboard,” insiders said. Meanwhile, K-P Minister for Information and Higher Education Mushtaq Ahmed Ghani warned that his government could suspend the distribution of electricity to other parts of country from Tarbela Dam if the federal government tried to disconnect a single power connection to K-P. Earlier Minister for Water and Power Khawaja Asif said that the government would disconnect power connections to those who refuse to pay their dues. Talking to media persons on phone, Ghani said that the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf’s (PTI) government in K-P would keep collecting taxes even though Imran Khan had announced the launch of a civil disobedience campaign. Claiming that the K-P government was not the product of rigging and have a genuine mandate, the minister said that it would continue serving and collecting taxes.","It is hard to understand Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif’s standards of likes and dislikes. No one knows exactly what qualities of Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa impressed the prime minister when he named him chief of army staff. Perhaps Bajwa’s commitment to democracy or his impartiality in the first dharna made him a good choice. Whatever the reason, the appointment of Gen Bajwa as COAS is perhaps the first and last best decision taken on merit by the prime minister. Gen Bajwa has a unique personality. He is one of the few generals who truly believe in the supremacy of democracy. Prior to becoming the chief, he was against political adventures by the military or the role of the agencies in politics. He is neither a religious fundamentalist nor a liberal fascist, and is a moderate soldier who considers extremism and terrorism detrimental to the peace and stability of the country. Gen Bajwa wishes to make Pakistan a safe, developed and prosperous country. He seems to be completely preoccupied with the task of ensuring the country’s defence and getting rid of the outdated conceptions of national security and foreign policy. Despite his strong position, Gen Bajwa’s personality is free from arrogance. Being a professional soldier, he believes in ensuring the country’s defence and, unlike his predecessors, he does not want to cash in on his endeavours or use his accomplishments for self-projection. However, he faces multiple challenges as well. Gen Bajwa has become the army chief at a very crucial time. Externally, the US is embittered, Afghanistan is irritated, Iran is annoyed and India is in an adventurous mode against Pakistan. Like the US, Saudi Arabia has also started to dictate Islamabad using the mantra of ‘with us or against us’. Internally, due to the precarious security situation, the army is engaged in a policing role and busy in military operations from Karachi to Fata and from Gilgit to Gwadar. The army chief’s task has been further complicated by the four crucial issues he inherited from Gen Raheel: the extraordinary glorification of Operation Zarb-e-Azb, Dawn leaks, a divided media and the idea of a nexus between corruption and terrorism and the fight against both simultaneously. On taking over, Gen Bajwa focused on weeding out these unnecessary but dangerous things. He took some bold steps which proved unpopular among the public and the army alike: giving relief to some PPP leaders, maintaining the army’s neutrality in the Panama issue, accepting the Supreme Court judgment and giving the message to Imran Khan and other politicians to follow suit. There was also the invitation to Jang Group journalists to the GHQ, letting the hype over the Dawn leaks calm down and the surrender of Ihsanullah Ihsan and other Taliban leaders. But unfortunately, the prime minister failed to reciprocate by changing his old perceptions about the army. He did not forget the Musharraf regime or the Raheel tenure. Some critics believe that the PM tried to exploit the benign approach of Gen Bajwa. For instance, after his appointment, the new chief visited the PM’s Office and made a smart salute to the prime minister either out of respect or habit. Instead of valuing the good gesture and reciprocating with humility, some of the members of the prime minister’s team attempted to satisfy their egos by leaking the picture of the COAS’ salute. Similarly, a video was also released showing the COAS sitting, unprecedentedly, across the table from the prime minister. Gen Bajwa did not take both these immature and unnecessary steps seriously. But it indeed sent a very wrong message to the army which started believing it as an intentional act by the civilian government. The newly appointed army chief accepted the PM’s narrative of the Dawn leaks. However, as the issue was already being assumed to be detrimental to the army’s image and prestige, Gen Bajwa made it clear that it could not be forgotten. Hence, it was mutually agreed that action would be taken against Tariq Fatemi and Rao Tahsin along with Pervaiz Rasheed. The government, though, unnecessarily dragged the matter and delayed it for one month. A notification was issued after the Panama judgment in the Supreme Court. The army assumed the delay as an attempt by the government to use the matter as a bargaining chip on the Panama issue. In addition, the notification was not what the government had promised the military leadership. And so, being offended and enraged, the army issued the infamous tweet on social media — rejecting the government’s notification. The words of the tweet were indeed inappropriate and a mistake that should not have happened. However, once it happened, it should not be made an issue of life and death. The matter could be resolved and middle way could be sorted out by mutual understanding. But the prime minister took the matter very serious and a situation was created which ultimately led to the army withdrawing the tweet. The withdrawal of the tweet did not go well in the rank and file of the army in the already complicated post-Panama judgment situation — a situation in which the PTI’s social media campaign had created the impression that Gen Bajwa had saved the prime minister, and Aitezaz Ahsan was raising questions against the DG ISI. Gen Bajwa himself called the withdrawal of the tweet a right but unpopular decision. Gen Bajwa strives hard to defend the country from internal and external enemies. However, at the same time, he is also supposed to live up to the expectations of his own institution. Currently, he seems to be moving in that direction. Let’s see whether the PM continues to remain stubborn or undoes his previous mistakes for the sake of his government and democracy."
