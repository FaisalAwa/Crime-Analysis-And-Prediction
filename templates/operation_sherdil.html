                        <h4 class="text-center p-3 mb-2 bg-dark text-danger" style="border-radius:15px;"><strong>Battle of Bajaur<strong></h4>
                        <p>The Battle of Bajaur (English: Operation Lion Heart), also known as Operation Sherdil, was a military campaign in the Bajaur region of Pakistan. It was conducted on 7 August 2008 by the Frontier Corps and Infantry Brigade of Pakistan army. The operation was primarily launched to end the political movement of the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan. Bajaur area was administered by Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan until 2007, and it remained Al-Qaeda's central command and control for carrying out activities in Northeast Afghanistan and Kunar province.[2][3] Recent reports indicate that ongoing conflict has newly displaced an estimate of 7,000 people between 3 and 4 March in Nurgal district.[4</p>
                            
                            <h4 class="text-center p-3 mb-2 bg-danger text-white" style="border-radius:15px;"><strong>Ambush in Bajaur<strong></h4>

                                <p>During the early days of August in 2008, a check-post was established by the Frontier Corps to seize control of the Afghan-Pakistan border crossing over Tehrik-e-Taliban. Check-post was constructed near the town of Loyesam which is 12 km away from Khaar.[5][6] Loyesam (or Loisam) is a strategic position that controls passage into Afghanistan's Kunar province. The militant attacks caused heavy casualties to the Pakistani army. Eventually, the army was relocated to Khar town.[2][7][8]</p>

                                <h4 class="text-center p-3 mb-2 bg-dark text-danger" style="border-radius:15px;"><strong>Background<strong></h4>
                                    
                                    <p>Several days later, the Frontier Corps began a large-scale offensive under the command of Major-General Tariq Khan, codenamed Operation Sherdil (Lion heart), intending to regain control of Bajaur from the Taliban.[9] About 8,000 troops belonging to the FC and Army, backed by Cobra attack helicopters and fighter jets were deployed that attacked Taliban hideouts. To support the Army, the Pakistan Air Force responded with aggressive air campaign. Pakistani military sources revealed that the army was surprised by the resistance of the insurgents. Taliban used advanced tactics to fight prepared defense system.[10]

                                        By the end of the year, the Army claimed that it had killed more than 1,000 militants, including the foreign commander of Al Qaeda, an Egyptian called Abu Saeed Al-Masri.[11] The Army suffered 20 casualties.[12] The military encouraged local tribes to rebel against the Taliban by raising the lashkars (tribal militias) to fight alongside the government forces. The Salarzai tribe reportedly counted 4,000 armed fighters, responded favorably to this initiative.[1] On 7 October, the Salarzai elders announced that they had cleared their tribal territory of militants, and requested the deployment of government troops to consolidate the gains they had made.[13]
                                        
                                        According to several sources, the Islamabad Marriott Hotel bombing might have occurred in retaliation for the military offensive in Bajaur.[10]
                                        
                                        On 8 October, during a briefing to the Parliament, the military announced that the operation killed 2,744 militants, including 321 foreigners, and caused 1,400 casualties to the militants.[14] On 25 October, the Pakistan forces reportedly recaptured Taliban militants in Loi Sam village.[15] About 500 militants were reportedly killed in the Bajaur area on 25 October.[16] By the end of 2008, security forces were stationed at Torghudai, Nawagai, Utmankhel, and Salarzai. By mid-2009, the security forces controlled the bulk of the Mamund and Chahrmang valleys as well. The last operation was launched in February 2010 with fresh reinforcements to mop up the last pockets of militants, including the notorious Damadola stronghold. Bajaur was ultimately declared clear in March 2010. When the operation was completed, a large number of militants surrendered before the army.</p>

                                            <p>On 28 February 2009,[17] the security forces defeated the Taliban and other Islamist militants in Bajaur, which was a strategically important region on the Afghan border. Major-General Tariq Khan, who was commanding the military operations in five of the seven agencies stated that the Army and the Frontier Corps killed most militants in Bajaur, the smallest of the agencies but a major infiltration route into Afghanistan, after a six-month long offensive. The Pakistan Army killed over 1,800 militants. However, the forces suffered 30 deaths and four wounded.</p>
