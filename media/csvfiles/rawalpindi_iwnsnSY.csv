Most incidents of street crimes were reported in New Town, Sadiqabad, Pirwadhai, Bani and Waris Khan police stations of Rawal Division.On the other hand, Potohar Division’s Cantt, Westridge, Airport, Morgah, Taxila, Naseerabad and Civil Lines police stations failed to protect citizens against street crimes.In Rawalpindi Saddar Division, citizens faced street crime incidents in the jurisdictions of Saddar Baruni, Dhamiyal, Chakri, Rawat and Gujar Khan police stations.Sources said Rawalpindi Police busted 12 highly active gangs and main suspects involved in street crime incidents in the first 20 days of Ramazan while efforts were being made to get maximum punishment awarded to them.They said the biggest obstacle in getting the suspects sentenced is citizens avoiding the process of identifying the accused. “If the citizens cooperate with the police investigation, the suspects may be punished,” they added.Police officials say that every effort is made to protect the life and property of the citizens, but the lack of resources and manpower is a big problem.Last year, the crime data obtained from police sources had also shown a huge increase in street crime incidents in the garrison city while the year 2022 proved to be as difficult for the people of the twin cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad as the preceding year as a significant increase in street crimes was witnessed in both cities despite tall claims of curbing the rate of crime by the police high-ups.Rawalpindi recorded a 154% increase in street crimes last year.
