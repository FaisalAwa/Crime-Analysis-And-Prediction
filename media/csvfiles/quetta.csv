"In total 129 cases of violence were recorded against women, says a report issued by the Aurat Foundation Balochsitan.

As per the report the provincial capital Quetta is on the top of the list as out of 129, the largest number of cases were recorded in Quetta.

There were 33 incidents of violence including 12 torture cases, three rape cases and two honour killing cases in Quetta last year.

Four cases of sexual harassment also occurred there. In 78 cases women were killed brutally including 49 honour killing cases and 29 other incidents in which women lost their lives.

After the murder, torture was the most widespread crime against women in the province with 28 cases reported.

Most of the honour killing cases were reported in Naseerabad district as 27 incidents occurred in this district alone.

Naseerabad was followed by Jaffarabad and Mastung with five cases each. Two cases each were reported from Zhob and Quetta districts and two from Kalat and Kohlu each.

Unfortunately, Quetta was on the top of the torture case with 12 incidents. Eight cases of murder of women were also reported from the capital city of Quetta, four from Lasbella and three from Khuzdar.

By the same token, across Balochistan 57 women and 21 men were murdered last year in a total 78 cases.

Around 28 women also lost lives to honour killing as in most cases girls were killed while their suitors were spared by the tribal Jirga.

It is worth noting here that these are only those cases reported in the media. A large number of cases are not reported to even police and very few of them are covered by media.

The report indicates that eight kidnapping cases of women also took place in the province along with five cases of rape and gang rape.

Talking to The Express Tribune Resident Director Aurat Foundation Allaudin Khilji said that the increasing number of violence cases again women is unfortunate.

“What is worrisome is that women are killed in the parts of Balochistan in the name of bad character and men are left alive and this custom has taken roots in the past few years,” he said, adding that it points all fingers to the traditional Jirga system which has turned the honour killing into a trade.

“Men are often produced before the Jirga for having a relationship with girls and they are often spared and asked to pay large fines in return,” he added, saying that tribal elders, intellectuals, parliamentarians and civil society should play its role in changing this situation.

“Women were killed in the name of honour, Karo Kari, raped, gang-raped, abducted and targeted in domestic violence cases across Balochistan,” he said, adding that women are treated with violence every in this province and country.

The intransigent political and security volatility of the southwestern province of Pakistan, Balochistan is inviting every kind of crime and violence to the province, where the current provincial government has failed to make its presence felt for all the practical purposes during last four years of its reign. Analyze any dimension of governance and one finds that the province has become a vast abyss of pervasive lawlessness, bad governance, economic mismanagement and crime. At a time when Quetta is rocked by incessant targeted killings, bomb blasts, and sectarian violence, other parts of the province are being ripped apart by the tsunami of kidnappings for ransom. Its special targets are though foreigners, well off and least protected Hindus and the Parsi entrepreneurs, others too, are not safe from the menace of kidnapping that indeed is rapidly emerging as the new lifeline for the criminals and militants in an age of sheer paucity of financial resources. Due to its strategic location, enormous area, thin populations and poor law enforcement infrastructure; Balochistan has become home to almost 70 criminal gangs, safe haven for nationalist and religious militant organizations and international terrorist groups.[*] All of these violent actors supplement each other in one way or the other, by creating security vacuums through their respective tools of inflicting violence and perpetuating lawlessness.

According to a recent report compiled by a nationalist political party in Balochistan, as many as 1, 047 persons have been abducted in the course of last four years.[1] These abductions were carried out purely out of financial motives and most of the times, abductors succeeded in getting money from the abductees– side. The practice is rapidly emerging as the much needed economic lifeline and convergence of interests between the criminals and militants operating in the province. Provincial Agriculture Minister Asadullah Baloch of BNP-Awami observed that ‘Abduction for ransom has become a lucrative business in Balochistan and people are joining this businessen masse as Police and Law Enforcement Agencies have failed to book a single culprit.’[2] Delineating upon the nature of nexus between criminals and militants in Balochistan, Ishaq Ali Changazi, a senior Quetta Crime Branch official said that ‘We have reports that gangs involved in ransom abduction have links with North Waziristan— and Afghanistan-based militants.’[3] Furthermore, underlining the link between militancy and abductions for ransom, renowned security analyst Dr. Hasan Askari-Rizvi illustrated that ‘Ransom abduction is a lucrative business, and some outlaws are using the Taliban as a cover for their activities; therefore, they are linked with the Taliban. Every rebellious movement needs strong pecuniary aid, and the Taliban are in need of such aid. Ransom abduction is a— major cash source for them.’[4] Likewise, former Pakistani federal secretary of interior, Tasneem M. Noorani,observed that ‘Such crime used to be rare; but kidnapping has become one of the guerrillas– main revenue sources.’[5] Thus, following the traditional patterns to sustain insurgencies, the adoption of the kidnapping tool by the militants to earn money does make sense.

The business of abductions for ransom is picking up in the province. And the chronic inefficacy of the law enforcement agencies (LEAs) in the hapless province is forcing more and more people to directly deal with the abductors for the safe release of their loved ones. As Police Department in Quetta shared that during 2012, so far 15 incidents of abduction for ransom were recorded in the city with the police, and 13 out of these were resolved after the payment of ransom money to the abductors.[6] The figures also underscore the impalpable role of LEAs in protecting the civilians and sorting out the abduction cases. Also, the scale of solution of kidnapping cases beyond the involvement of LEAs is witness to the fact of common people trust in the capability of this state security apparatus in providing safety and security. On top of all this, inflating cases of direct dealings between kidnappers and relatives of the kidnapped persons bear testimony to the fact that kidnappers are collecting huge sum of money out of this business.

Surprisingly abductors out of financial motives are, most of the times, targeting religious minorities and foreigners in the province, especially Hindus due to their well off status and relatively insecure circumstances. There are around 200,000 Hindus living in the province and mostly run business and trade. Sharing the figures of the people of Hindu origin kidnapped in 2012, Provincial Minister for Human Rights and Minorities– Affairs Basant Lal Gulshan noted that during the current year 25 persons of his community are kidnapped in the province and in 2011, the number of kidnapped was 55. He lamented the apathy of provincial government that whenever he took up the issue before lawmakers in the assembly, they responded that the practice of abduction is not exclusively directed against Hindus, rather people from all communities are target.[7] But there are media and Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) reports suggesting that minorities, be it ethnic or religious, are the prime target of kidnappers in the province, due to their affluence. Consequently, kidnappers are making huge money out of abductions involving Punjabis, Hindus, Parsis, Zoroastrians, etc.[8]

Moreover, the surge in kidnappings of the Hindus in recent months was also confirmed by the Balochistan Chief Secretary Ahmed Bakhsh Lehri. He noted that almost one third (24) out of the total 72 kidnapped during past few months were belonging to the Hindu community. Later on 21 people were recovered through the efforts of the community itself, while the fate of three abducted persons still hangs in balance.[9] Likewise, Zoroastrians, who no longer live in Balochistan, were also the target of kidnappers. As former provincial minister for minorities and owner of Quetta Distillery Ltd., Faridoon Abadan, was snatched by the unknown abductors 10 years ago and his whereabouts are yet to be known. Then in February 2011, his wife Nilofer, was picked up and emerged as the first case of woman kidnapping in the province, but was released after paying PKR 30 million in ransom to the kidnappers.[10] Meanwhile, Dr Rajish Kumar, son of Dr Nand Lal who is a member of the HRCP Quetta chapter as well as of the Pak-India People Forum for Peace and Democracy was kidnapped in February this year from Quetta and abductors are demanding PKR 20 million for his release. So far police has failed to trace the abductors and recover him.[11] These cases suggest that kidnappers are behind minorities in the province for acquiring more and more ransom money. Also, it is easy choice for the kidnappers to go after minorities, since the latter are least protected and relatively affluent community ready to pay ransom rather preferring to seek police help in getting back their community members.

Foreigners and come next on the target list of kidnappers and the recent history dates back to the abduction of an American citizen John Solecki, regional head of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) in Quetta allegedly by the Baloch militants in January 2009. Though he was released safely after months of back channel dealings with the kidnappers, yet the exact nature of dealings and circumstances of his release remain unclear. Then on July 1, 2011, militants belonging to TTP took along a Swiss couple, Olivier David Och and Daniela Widmar, in the Killi Nigah area in Loralai District of Balochistan. The couple was later on shifted to South Waziristan Agency of Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA). TTP demanded to release the detained Pakistani scientist, Aafia Siddiqui, in the US in exchange for the Swiss couple. Later on in March 2012, the Swiss couple managed to escape from the captivity of TTP. But a March 30, 2012, media report disclosed that a huge ransom of PKR 1 billion was paid to the abductors for the release of the Swiss couple. Later on, in January 2012, unidentified gunmen abducted a British official of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), Doctor Khalil Ahmed Dale, from the Chaman Housing Society in Quetta. The abductors demanded USD 30 million for the release of the British doctor, but on failure to get the demanded money, they slaughtered him in April.[12]

III

The kidnappers are also targeting foreigners and foreign NGOs officials working in Balochistan in order to achieve two objectives simultaneously: the first is to earn huge money and the second is to scare away the foreign NGOs working in the impoverished province for the development and uplift of local people. Statistically, they are succeeding in attaining both of their objectives so far. As in case of abduction of five men working for the US based Mercy Corps in 2010 from Balochistan, abductors managed to get USD 250,000 from the organization, and at the same time forced it to shut down 44 offices all across Sindh and Balochistan.[13] Likewise, two local employees of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) were gunned down in Mastung town in March 2012 and forced the agency to restrict its activities in the province.[14] Meanwhile, ICRC also closed down three of its centers in restive Balochistan after the increase in kidnappings for ransom in the province in recent months. Moreover, according to local sources, kidnappers also took away a local official of the UNHCR a few months back, while he was travelling in his car in interior Balochistan. Later on, UNHCR and his family paid whopping PKR 100 million to the abductors for safe recovery of the official. Out of this huge sum, 50 percent was paid by the UNHCR and rest of the money was arranged by the family itself.[¡]

Thus the targeting of the minorities and foreigners working with the NGOs and resultant flight of the foreign NGOs from the province beg for special attention of the political and security establishment of the province. Recent trends and evidences suggest that there is emerging close operational cooperation between criminals and militants in the province, which though operating with different motives yet aid each other in achieving their respective goals. There are investigative reports cobbled together by the provincial home department, underlining the emerging nexus between criminal gangs and nationalist militants in the province. ‘Many criminal groups involved in ransom abductions are linked with the Taliban Haqqani network,’ a senior intelligence sourcenoted.[15] Figures in recent years suggest that kidnappers due to their outreach, choice of the targets and professionalism in handling the targets are achieving maximum results out of their bids.

Swelling cases of kidnappings also underlines the scale of pervasive inefficacy reigning inside the LEAs in the province. There are three kinds of security agencies working in the province with a total strength of 83,800 personnel[16] to guard an area inhibited by almost eight million people. But the factors which are undercutting the performance of the security agencies, are lack of cooperation among them, technological backwardness and sheer want of the skilled manpower among officers– cadres, especially of the police department. As a former senior police officer in Balochistan observed that ‘The grade 17 to 18 police officers are serving on grade 20 posts. There are no senior officers. The senior officials are needed to control crime,’ he added.[17] Regarding lack of technology to track down abductors, Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Police Quetta Hamid Shakeel lamented the fact that police department has no equipment to trace the cell phone calls, and it has written to the federal intelligence agencies to provide the necessary surveillance gadgets, but to no avail as yet.[18]

Thus at a time, when the abductors are on the loose in the province and targeting vulnerable segments of the society in Balochistan, there is need to provide more safety and security to the least protected people. These people are contributing towards enriching the local culture and aiding the locals in their struggle to beat the pervasive miseries of daily life. The provincial government should take the leading role and put more financial and human resources at the disposal of LEAs to stem out the endemic of abduction in the province. On the contrary, there are ample chances that with the current level of intervention by those who matter in curbing this menace, the scale of kidnappings would keep surging and in the process empowering the kidnappers and pushing the people deeper into the abyss of physical insecurity and financial losses.

""The Baloch Liberation Army accepts responsibility for this attack and we reiterate our commitment that all atrocities against the Baloch people will be held to account,"" Jeeyand Baloch, spokesperson for the BLA, said.
Senior police official Shafqat Cheema told Reuters the target of the first attack was the vehicle of the acting superintendent of police investigations, which was parked in Kandahari Bazar.

He said initial reports showed an improvised device containing 4 to 5 kg (9 to 11 pounds) of explosive was planted in a motorcycle parked behind the vehicle and detonated remotely.

A roadside bomb targeting a police vehicle in volatile southwestern Pakistan on April 10 killed at least four people and wounded 15 others, mostly civilian pedestrians, a government spokesperson said.

The attack happened in Quetta, the capital of Baluchistan province, said Babar Yousafzai, a spokesman for the provincial government. He said the dead included two officers and two civilians.

No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, but suspicion fell on the Pakistani Taliban, who have stepped up attacks across the country since November when they ended a monthslong cease-fire with the government.
Pakistan has also been battling an insurgency in Baluchistan for more than a decade, with separatists in the province demanding complete autonomy or a larger share of the province’s gas and mineral resources.

In a statement, provincial chief minister Abdul Qudoos Bizenjo condemned the attack and ordered authorities to provide the best possible medical care to the wounded.

The Pakistani Taliban, who are known as Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, have claimed previous such attacks in Baluchistan and elsewhere. The militant group is separate from, but allied with, the Afghan Taliban.

The latest attack comes a day after the TTP shot and killed two police officers in Quetta. One of the assailants was also killed when police returned fire after coming under attack in the city Sunday night.
One man belonging to the marginalised Hazara community was martyred and 13 others sustained injuries as an improvised explosive device (IED) exploded inside a shoe market on the city’s Mission Road on Tuesday.

Talking to journalists at the crime scene, Quetta DIG Abdul Razzaq Cheema said a terrorist, pretending to be a customer, bought a pair of shoes and placed the explosive device packed in a box outside the shop. “As he walked away from the Jinnah Shoe Market, the device exploded, killing one Hazara shoe vendor and injuring 13 others – mostly belonging to Shia Hazara community.”

The explosion smashed the windows of nearby shops and shopping malls. A heavy contingent of law enforcement agencies reached the spot and shifted the body and the injured to Civil Hospital Quetta for medical treatment.

The Bomb Disposal Squad and Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) teams cordoned off the market in order to collect evidence from the crime scene, which would help ascertain the nature of the explosion.

“Terrorists have been changing their strategies following visible security measures in Quetta city, but we would further improve security mechanism across the city,” said DIG Cheema, adding that, “I don’t think Hazara community has been targeted because many people belonging to other communities were also among the injured.”

Balochistan Chief Minister Jam Kamal Khan strongly condemned the attack and expressed grief over the loss of innocent lives. “Terrorists have been targeting innocent citizens but security forces have been carrying out regular actions against timid enemies.”

CM Kamal ordered strict security measures across the province ahead of Eidul Azha and Independence Day celebrations.

No group has so far claimed responsibility for the blast, but it was the second terrorists attack in a week and third in the last fortnight in the provincial capital. All three attacks took place on consecutive Tuesdays.

On July 23, a blast had occurred in the Eastern Bypass area which left four people dead and 32 injured. On July 30, five people, including two policemen, were killed and 31 others injured after a blast ripped through a police van at Quetta’s Meezan Chowk.

The banned Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan had claimed responsibility for the blast near the police station. The Balochistan cabinet, which was in session when last week’s blast took place, had vowed to bring terrorists and their facilitators to justice and said that such attacks could not weaken the determination of the government against terrorists and their masters.

Meanwhile, talking to the media, Balochistan Home Minister Zia Langove vowed to eliminate terrorism from the province. “Unfortunately, our neighbouring country has been importing terrorism in Pakistan through our province,” he remarked.

“Pakistan has been plagued with a wave of terrorism during the last two decades, but our security forces have been utilising all resources in order to protect the lives and properties of masses,” Langove said.
