"District Faisalabad reported the most crimes in October 2011 constituting 11% of the 32,021 FIRs filed for the 27 observed crimes in 73 districts nationwide. The highest number of FIRs in the district were lodged for murder, attempted murder, hurt, robbery and dacoity, criminal trespass, criminal breach of trust, counterfeiting currency notes and bank notes, theft, motor vehicle lifting, forced marriages and other crimes. Gujranwala (7%) and Multan (4%) were the second and third most crime reporting districts respectively. FAFEN monitors visited 73 offices of the District Police Officers (DPOs) to gather information on FIRs registered for 27 offences falling under the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC).

Of the 73 districts monitored, 25 were in Punjab, 20 in KP, 17 in Sindh and 11 in Balochistan. Among the different categories, crimes pertaining to property were the most frequently reported (17%), followed by those ensuing physical harm (11%), threat and fraud (7%) and crimes against women (4%). The most crimes among the monitored categories were registered in Punjab, followed by KP, Sindh and Balochistan.

Better outreach and the absence of parallel judicial systems in the regions are the probable reasons for this pattern of crime reportage. Of the registered crimes, FIRs for theft were the most frequent with 2,014 recorded in 61 districts, followed by hurt with 1,702 in 64 districts and 1,294 lodged for counterfeiting of currency-notes and bank-notes in 36 districts. Crimes pertaining to property were the most frequently reported with six of the top 10 frequently reported crimes falling in this category.

However, crimes ensuing physical harm were the most widespread. As many as 726 FIRs for murder were reported in 68 of the 73 districts monitored, 794 for attempted murder in 67 districts and 1,702 hurt FIRs in 64 districts. Threat and fraud crimes were the third most frequently reported. Of the 2,406 registered FIRs under this head, the most (54%) were for counterfeiting currency-notes. Seventeen percent of the FIRs were filed for cheating, 14% for criminal breach of trust, 12% for criminal intimidation, 2% for offences against public tranquility and 1% for fraudulent deeds and dispossession of property. Though crimes against women constituted 2% of the total crimes, some of the most heinous and inhumane acts fall under this category. Despite awareness and a more widespread educational system, crimes like forced marriages and honour killings were still registered.

Of the 781 FIRs lodged for crimes against women, 33% were registered for forced marriages with the highest numbers being recorded in districts of Faisalabad (42), followed by Gujranwala (40) and Sahiwal (37). Twenty seven percent of the total FIRs for crimes against women were those of rape, 24% for assault or criminal force intended to outrage the modesty of a woman, 12% for offences related to marriage and 4% for honour killings.

Cases of honour killings were registered in all the four provinces. In Sindh, 15 FIRs were registered, of which six were in Shikarpur, three in Kamber Shahdadkot, two in Ghotki and one each in Khairpur, Larkana, Naushahro Feroze and Sukkur. Of the 10 FIRs lodged in Punjab, two each were in Sahiwal, Lodhran, Sargodha and Faisalabad while one each was registered in Hafizabad and Rahimyar Khan. One case each was filed in Peshawar and Swabi districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and in Nasirabad and Jaffarabad districts of Balochistan. Combating such crimes requires serious attention of the relevant authorities that need to not only educate the masses but also establish and implement laws effectively.

The city has 42 police stations in which 90 posts of inspectors are sanctioned. However, there are 56 inspectors and a shortage of 34 officials, as per official statistics.

There are 228 sub-inspectors as compared to 295 posts, with a shortage of 67 officials. There are 685 ASI serving on the 728 posts, showing a shortage of 43.

Instead of 954 head constables, 887 are posted, while 97 posts are vacant. Instead of 6,398 constables, 6,214 are serving, while 184 posts are vacant.

There are 13 police circles in the city’s five towns. The city and regional police officers along with 13 DSPs, five SPs, SSP operations and SSP investigation look after the affairs of district police.

The government’s promises to overcome the shortage of police stations and personnel in the city in proportion to the population have not yet been fulfilled.

Faisalabad, the third-largest city in the country in terms of population, has a 100-year history.

Settlement in the city began during the British rule and it was renamed as Faisalabad in 1985 after Saudi King Shah Faisal. During the British rule, a historic clock tower was built in 1903, which became the identity of the city.

The historic buildings of the city were built while keeping in view the need for security of the life and property of the citizens.

The oldest police station is in Saddar, which was established in 1898. The significance of the police station can also be proven from the fact that it has the largest precinct among the 42 police stations in Faisalabad.

Faisalabad witnesses alarming surge in crime rate

Senior police officials, instead of going after the criminals, are blatantly denying the increase in crime. They claim that the incidents are relatively few for a city like Faisalabad.

The actual number of the incidents of crimes is almost double as the police are reluctant to register the cases to cover up the deteriorating law and order situation prevalent in the city. Seeing the surge in criminal activities over the last few weeks, it is expected that the total number of such acts will surpass that of 2016.

During the past 48 hours, the outlaws took away 28 motorcycles, six cars and committed more than 74 other incidents of thefts, robberies, street crimes depriving the citizens of millions of rupees. An atmosphere of fear and insecurity prevails in the city as police have failed to arrested criminals.
Cash, cell phones and other valuables worth millions of rupees were looted in robberies at different shops in Allied Hospital area, Garden Colony, Bagadai Park, Betala Colony, Canal Road, Saifabad, Liaquatabad, Jhang Road, Millat Colony and other areas.

Earlier, while commenting on the sense of insecurity prevailing in the city, Chaudhary Abdul Majeed, a leading lawyer, told The Express Tribune that the major causes of surge in crimes included lack of police patrolling especially in the rural areas.

“Gone are the days when the police were recording each and every occurrence of crime in true perspective way and not concealing the facts discharging their duties in a transplant manner,” he siad.
The police team returned fire and as a result, Mubashar received bullet wounds and died instantly. However, the other accused managed to flee the scene.

The deceased was wanted to police for the killing of ASI Hamid Naseer. In another incident, six armed bandits opened fire on police team to free their three accomplices, Husnain, Sajid and Asif, near Gokhuwala village on Millat Road. Following the ensuing gunfight, all three accused were wounded and later admitted to an area hospital."
