On the left side, a pistol can be seen with a finger on the trigger. While we do not see the face of the person holding the gun, identified as student Bisma, we hear her voice as she narrates how the incident unfolded.“This man tried to snatch my purse while I was waiting with my mother at the bus stations,” she can be heard saying in a charged voice. “He tried to shoot me with this,” she says while brandishing the pistol.At this point of the video, the criminal pleads for leniency, saying he has small daughters. “Am I not someone’s daughter,” the woman snaps back before asking about his accomplice. In another video, both accomplices can be seen inside a police vehicle. During all this, she remains adamant of capturing their faces on video and uploading it on social media.The video soon made it to social media platforms of news channels and even featured in bulletins. The university student’s interview flashed on news channel who hailed her as the lionness of Gujranwala.In her interview, she said that she was waiting for the university bus with her mother when two men on a motorcycle accosted them. “One of them took out the gun from under the chador.”The intrepid teenager turned the tables by somehow disarming the man and taking his gun. A crowd gathered quickly as the men ended up on the ground begging for mercy.“To consider women as weak creatures is a crude simplifcation,” she said, while urging others to also be courageous.The girl has been feted and celebrated, and is is very likely that the local police might announce a reward for her bravery.Speaking at the Gujranwala Chamber of Commerce and Industry, he said 13,000 cases of dacoity and robbery had been reported since 2010.He said police had arrested more than 1,500 people in these cases but they could not be given exemplary punishment by courts for lack of witnesses.He said a command control and communication centre was being constructed on Sialkot by-pass intersection at a cost of Rs 4 billion to trace criminals through CCTV cameras."
