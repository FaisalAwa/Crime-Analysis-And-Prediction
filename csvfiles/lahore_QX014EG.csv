"The official data of the crime of the first three-and-a-half months of the year paints a very dismal picture. Over 90pc of the crime has been committed at gunpoint, showing the robbers fearlessly brandishing illegal weapons in the city to deprive the citizens of cash and valuables. The criminals are so desperate and fearless of the police action that they are even lifting bicycles too. The thieves have taken away 143 bicycles from various parts of the provincial capital during the first three-and-a-half months of this year besides 5,366 motorcycles.

Lahore has six police divisions, 35 circles and 84 police stations. Each division is headed by a superintendent of police (SP) while circles are headed by sub-divisional police officers (SDPOs). But despite the appointment of so many police officers in such a large number, the criminals are on rampage, looting and depriving citizens of their belongings fearlessly. The official data shows that 89 citizens have been allegedly murdered in Lahore in about the first quarter of 2023.
